description: Get started with installing Peargent in your Python environment.
---
To install Peargent **<u>python package</u>**, you can use `pip` or `uv`. It's recommended to install **Peargent** inside a **virtual environment (venv)** to manage dependencies effectively.

```bash tab="pip"
pip install peargent
```
```bash tab="uv"
uv pip install peargent
```

If you don't have a virtual environment set up, you can create one using the following commands:

```bash tab="bash"
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

After activating the virtual environment, run the pip install command above to install **Peargent**.
